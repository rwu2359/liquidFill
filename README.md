Original at: https://gist.github.com/brattonc/5e5ce9beee483220e2f6

Configurable features include:

- Changeable min/max values.
- All colors.
- Outer circle thickness.
- Gap between the outer circle and inner fill area.
- Wave height.
- Wave speed.
- Wave count.
- Wave rise time.
- Wave height scaling on/off. Reduces the wave height near the min/max values so that the wave won't make the fill area appear total full or totally empty.
- Wave starting offset. Most useful when wave animation is turned off and you want the wave min or max at a specific horizontal position in the fill area.
- Wave rising upon load on/off.
- Wave animation on/off.
- Text height.
- Text vertical position.
- Text increment from min value upon loading.
- Display of % symbol on/off.
